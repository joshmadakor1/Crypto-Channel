1. You must vote with the template: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/Crypto-Channel/main/Voting-Template.txt
2. For the "Explanation" for your vote, links to articles, videos, and/or threads are OK.
3. Your recommended coin/token/etc., must have "sufficient" liquidity.
4. Recommendations for staking are OK. For example, you might vote for Ohm and say, "I think you should buy $2k of Ohm and stake it."
5. Iâ€™m probably not going to buy NFTs at this point.
